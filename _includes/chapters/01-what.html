        The first question of all is why we should analyze the movie industry. There is money. A lot of money. 
        The flourishing film industry in 2019 achieved a global box office worth of around $42.2 billion. One year earlier, in 2018, 
        when including home entertainment, this market segment was priced at $136 billion. For comparison, in 2018, Denmark's GDP was $556.8 billion, and Switzerland's GDP was
        $735.5 billion. And single most popular titles, such as Top Gun: Maverick or Avatar, brought box office revenues of respectively $1.49 billion or $2.92 billion worldwide. 
        This shows how big of a deal for the filmmakers it is to draw up a good recipe for an entertaining and gripping movie!

        Throughout this data story, we will walk you through analyzing the popular movies' plots and extracting their 
	    key sentiment ingredients. Humans are emotional beings, and let's be honest, they watch only movies
        close to their hearts. Therefore, besides assessing general sentiment, we will dive deeper and focus on, closest to the human soul, emotions. 
        This connection to emotion in the movies was actually also somehow contained in the famous quote by movie director Rich Moore - 
        "A good movie makes the audience feel like they've journeyed with the characters".
        Moreover, we will try to answer how and which manifestations of violence influence movie popularity. All of these movie aspects will 
        result in an ultimate cookbook for any aspiring movie creator containing the right emotion-related ingredients for a successful movie.
