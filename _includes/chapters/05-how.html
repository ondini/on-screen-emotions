        From the table above, we can see correlations with the help of which we can answer an really interesting question â€“ do the sentiments really matter?

In the first row, we can see the correlation between revenue and rating and we can detect that revenue and rating have a small positive but very significant (p<<0.05) correlation. This makes perfect sense that people want to watch preferably better than worse movies. If revenue and rating are correlated, what about they correlating with sentiments? We can eliminate correlations between revenue & surprise and rating correlating with anger, joy and surprise. We do so on the basis that the p-value is over 0.05 which makes them not correlated. Based on this table, by increasing anger and fear, we could make more money as revenue is correlating positively with anger and fear. However, by increasing fear, based on the table, our rating would be lower. Also by increasing the amount of joy, our revenue would decrease. Thus, this makes a puzzle which is not so clear! Each of the genres have their own main sentiments and because people choose what do they like, we can't then determine for example that by increasing anger and fear, it is an easy path to success in every genre. So, sentiments matter, but by just by adding more fights to the movie doesn't guarantee you a blockbuster!
